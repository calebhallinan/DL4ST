The plan:

10 lectures 2 hours and 45 minutes each
Can be less if I make it 1 credit vs 2 credits


Lecture 1: 
- Intro to myself
- goals of the class
- intro to the github and how to work with it
- quick review of git and python


- intro to deep learning
- intro to pytorch


Lecture 2:
- intro to pytorch
- in class work of pytorch


Lecture 3:
- intro to pytorch
- in class work of pytorch


Lecture 4:
- intro to spatial transcriptomics
- working with spatial transcriptomics data in python


Lecture 5:
- pytorch with spatial transcriptomics


Lecture 6:
- review and more details
- applications of deep learning to spatial transcriptomics


Lecture 7:
- pytorch with spatial transcriptomics project work day 1


Lecture 8:
- pytorch with spatial transcriptomics project work day 2


Lecture 9:
- 


Lecture 10:
- pytorch with spatial transcriptomics project presentations


Thoughts:
- final project is predicting gene expression and is a competition, whoever gets best pearson correlation wins!
	- use basic CNN, basic MLP and explain why they choose what they did!
	- 
- maybe in class but zoom and everyone joins the meeting so people can easily share their screens
